        name: "Steel Cut Wire Shot",
        description: "Orient Cut Wire Shot are made of cold drawn spring steel wire with a high content of carbon (C) and is obtained by cutting wire into lengths equal to the wire diameter, and then making it round if necessary through the conditioning (rounding) process. The quality is assured in cut-wire shot because the wire from which it has been produced is heat treated and cold drawn to achieve hardness and homogeneity. This, together with the balanced chemical properties and complete solidity of every piece, insure that cut-wire shot will not fracture, break or powder while in use.",

        name: "Steel Shot & Grit",
        description: "Orient shot are produced under a controlled manufacturing process to achieve a product of uniform hardness, density and microstructure, coupled with good toughness for durability. These factors result in abrasives of sufficient hardness to perform its cleaning function as well as an extended life. Orient abrasives come in two forms: shot, grit.<br>Steel shot is actually a sphere-shaped form of steel casting. The shot is manufactured by pouring a molten mixture of premium grade steel scrap and select alloys through a series of water jets. On contact with the water, the molten metal is atomized, forming round particles in a controlled range of sizes. These particles then fall into a water tank, are then dried, screened by size, quenched and tempered in a unique heat-treating process. A process that assures ultimate control over the microstructure and hardness of the product, prior to a final screening.<br><br>Steel Grit is made by crushing the fully hardened shot, screening the resulting media and tempering it to a desired hardness. Grit works best in tumblast applications where the eccentric rebound aids coverage. It is used in conting and/or rust removal where speed of cleaning is critical and somewhat rough finish is acceptable.",

        name: "Copper Slag",
        description: "Copper slag is a by-product of copper extraction by smelting. During smelting, impurities become slag which floats on the molten metal. Slag that is quenched in water produces angular granules which are used for surface blast-cleaning. The blasting media manufactured from copper slag brings less harm to people and environment than sand. The product meets the most rigid health and ecological standards",
